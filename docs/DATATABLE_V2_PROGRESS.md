### Optional
- [x] Upgrade Storybook to v9.1.13 (completed - commit fceb06e)

---

## Notes

### Tailwind Class Generation
The UI package needs to be rebuilt whenever new Tailwind classes are used. Run:
```bash
pnpm --filter @one-portal/ui build
```

### Dark Mode Support
Need to ensure dark: prefixes are applied to all table elements:
- Table background
- Border colors
- Text colors
- Row hover states
- Empty/loading/error states

### Storybook Upgrade
Current: v8.5.3
Available: v9.1.11
Command: `npx storybook@latest upgrade`
