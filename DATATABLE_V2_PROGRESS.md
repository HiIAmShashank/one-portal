## Current Issues (User Reported)

### High Priority
1. **Loading state flickering** - Scrollwheel appears/disappears, spinner not working
2. **Tailwind classes missing** - `px-6` and `even:bg-muted/30` not available
3. **Dark mode broken** - Background changes but table doesn't theme
4. **Need className prop** - Allow custom CSS classes

### Tasks
- [ ] Fix loading state spinner and scrollwheel flicker
- [ ] Rebuild UI package with Tailwind to generate missing classes
- [ ] Fix dark mode theming on table elements
- [ ] Add/improve className prop for custom styling
- [ ] Upgrade Storybook to v9.1.11

---

## Notes

### Tailwind Class Generation
The UI package needs to be rebuilt whenever new Tailwind classes are used. Run:
```bash
pnpm --filter @one-portal/ui build
```

### Dark Mode Support
Need to ensure dark: prefixes are applied to all table elements:
- Table background
- Border colors
- Text colors
- Row hover states
- Empty/loading/error states

### Storybook Upgrade
Current: v8.5.3
Available: v9.1.11
Command: `npx storybook@latest upgrade`
